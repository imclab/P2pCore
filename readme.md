P2P-Core - Peer-to-peer framework
=================================

P2P-Core is a Peer-to-peer framework written in Scala. It enables direct datagram socket communication for devices between firewalls. This framework is made for portability. The goal is to use it for Gnome/GTK as well as for Android.

--- WORK IN PROCESS STILL --- PROJECT WILL BE RELEASED April 23 2012 ---


Building from source
--------------------

Scala 2.9.x, JDK 1.6 and Ant need to be installed: 

    apt-get install scala ant

To build the project, run:

    ./make

This `make` script will run three steps:

  1. compile P2pCore.java generated by the protocol buffer compiler using Ant
  2. compile all src/*.scala classes using Scalac
  3. run ./makejar script which uses jar to create p2pCore.jar

Running the code 
----------------

A `run` script is used to execture the different functionality. It adds the newly built p2pCore.jar and the three 3rp party libraries mentioned above to the classpath and uses the scala runtime to run the specified class.

Two instances of the software need to be run in parallel, either on separate machines or in separate terminals. (Running both instances on the same machine does probably mean they are running in the same network and also behind the same firewall. It is possible to run two instances in this way, but it does obviously defeat the purpose of the project. Ideally you will use two machines running in two different networks, behind different firewalls.)

# RelayBase

    ./run timur.p2pCore.RelayBase
  
RelayBase can be executed without parameters. RelayBase implements two methods and has only a dozen lines of code. Method 1: `connectedThread()` is called when a p2p connection via relay server has been established. All we do here is call `send("data")`. Method 2: `receiveMsgHandler(str:String)` is called when a string message arrives from the other client. If the string message is "data", we quit the application. This is what is being displayed, when looking at one instance:

    RelayBase relaySocket.getLocalPort=50582 relayServer=109.74.203.226 relayPort=18771
    RelayBase receiveHandler send encrypted initialMsg=[...]
    RelayBase connectedThread send='data'
    RelayBase connectedThread finished
    RelayBase receiveMsgHandler 'data'; setting relayQuitFlag

Todo
----

- RelayEncrypt out-of-date needs fix; still using "keys/key0" "keys/key0.pub"
- ./run timur.p2pCore.RelayBench needs fix: "print duration time"
